# Digital Portfolio Builder

## Objective
The Digital Portfolio Builder platform allows developers to build and showcase their digital portfolios. The platform integrates multimedia, code, and project documentation to provide a comprehensive way for developers to present their work. 

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: For building  user interface and responsive design.
  
### Backend:
- **Node.js**: For building the backend and handling user authentication, data storage, and API requests.
  
### Database:
**MongoDB**: For storing user data, project details, portfolio content, and related information.

## Features

### 1. **Code Integration**
The platform allows users to embed GitHub repositories or live code demos within their portfolio. This helps developers showcase their coding projects and make their portfolios more interactive.

### 2. **Multimedia Support**
Users can include videos, images, and presentations alongside their project descriptions. This feature helps in demonstrating projects more effectively, particularly for web developers, app developers, or creative portfolios.

### 3. **Skill Showcase**
The platform provides a way for users to highlight their key skills, certifications, and accomplishments. Users can include links to external sources like GitHub projects, certification bodies, or even LinkedIn to further validate their expertise.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (for frontend)
- **npm** (for managing packages)
 **MongoDB** (for database)
